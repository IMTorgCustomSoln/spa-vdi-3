Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses simple text formatting to structure documents. It's designed to be easy to read and write, and it can be easily converted to HTML or other formats. Alternatives to Markdown include reStructuredText (rST), AsciiDoc, and even HTML itself, each offering varying levels of complexity and features.
