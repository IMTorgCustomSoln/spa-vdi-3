“Thank you for giving me a chance…”
I’d just like to say thank you for giving me a chance. I was forced to retire before I could really afford to, thus creating an impossible financial situation that caused my score of 804 to plummet. So, thank you. Julie
“Credit One always has knowledgeable people…”
I find that Credit One always has knowledgeable people and notifies me when I need to know. It is good when someone has your back!  Delia
“Credit One helped us out when no other credit companies would…”
Credit One helped us out when no other credit companies would. 
When COVID hit we had to close our business, and we almost lost our house. 
Credit One gave us a small limit but after using the credit card and paying it off each month our increase was substantial, which helped! 
I would 100% recommend Credit One!! 
The app is easily usable, and I love the automatic payments. 
I needed to get a replacement card, I did that on the app and my credit is steadily rising where it used to be!! 
They alert if there’s suspicious activity or if there was fraudulent activity, they make it right!! I highly recommend this company!!!  Monica
“We both now have scores in the low 700s...”
After multiple credit denials for even secured credit cards, Credit One Bank took a chance on us. 
Both my wife and I were able to get approved for an Unsecured Credit line shortly after we filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. 
Through this credit, we have been able to re-establish our profile and improve our scores by 200 points in the past 2 years. 
We both now have scores in the low 700s. 
We were able to recently secure a lease for a new car, which would not have been possible if it wasn’t for Credit One taking a chance. 
I would recommend this company to anyone looking to re-establish credit. 
We hit rock bottom after our bankruptcy and didn’t see any way out of the hole we had dug.
Thank you for taking a chance on us. 
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to demonstrate the ability to be responsible again. 
Credit One was going to be our last hope to get a credit card. 
If we hadn’t been approved I know we wouldn’t have a safe, reliable vehicle for our 3 beautiful children. 
Thank you again for taking a chance.  Ray K.
